It is basically important to know some basic concepts to create basic application using TensorFlow.

Lets get breif about some of concepts.....

# 1) Vector

It is an array consist of numbers, which can be either discrete or contineous. 

To deal with multidimensioanl data we need to know to work with vectors.

Scalar can be defined as one-dimensional vector. Scalars are those, which include only magnitude and no direction. With scalars, we are only concerned with the magnitude.

# 2) Matrix

Matrix can be defined as multi-dimensional arrays, which are arranged in the format of rows and columns. 
The size of matrix is defined by row length and column length. Following figure shows the representation of any specified matrix.
