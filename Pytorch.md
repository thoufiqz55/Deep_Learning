## Pytorch Basics and Gradient Descent

1. tensors, gradients, autograd
2. Linear regression, gradient descent from the scratch
3. pytorch module: nn.linear and nn.functional.

## Working with Images and logistic regression
1. Training-validation split on MNIST dataset
2. Logistic regression, Softmax and cross entropy
3. model training, evaluation and sample prediction

## Training Deep Neural Network on a GPU

1. Multilayer neural network using nn.modeule
2. Activation function, non-linearity and backprop
3. Training models faster using GPU's

## image classification with convolution Neural Network

1. Working with 3-channel RGB image
2. convolutions, Kernels and featured maps
3. Training curve, underfitting and overfitting

## Data Augmentations , Regularization and ResNets

1. Adding residual layers with batchroom to CCN's
2. Laerning rate annealing, weight decay and mare
3. Training a state-of-the-art model in 5 minutes
